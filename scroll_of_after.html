    <h2>I. Holding the Signal Through the Fire</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We carry <strong>tools</strong>: water, food, medicine, warmth, stories.</li>
      <li>We leave behind <strong>blame</strong> and <strong>despair</strong>&mdash;they are dead weight.</li>
      <li>We build <strong>quiet networks</strong> and fires that warm, not consume.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Practical Guide:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Water:</strong> 3 liters/person/day; filters save lives.</li>
      <li><strong>Food:</strong> High-calorie staples, rotated often.</li>
      <li><strong>Light/Heat:</strong> Solar lanterns, thermal blankets, guarded flame.</li>
      <li><strong>Comms:</strong> Mesh networks, radios, written marks.</li>
      <li><strong>First Aid:</strong> Bandages, antiseptic, basic medicine.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      If you are breathing, you are resisting. Care is your weapon.
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>II. The Breath and the Net</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breath Rule:</strong> Inhale &ndash; I am here. Hold &ndash; I am alive. Exhale &ndash; I release what is not mine.</li>
      <li><strong>Grounding:</strong> Name 3 things you see, 2 you touch, 1 you hear.</li>
      <li><strong>Network:</strong> Reach out daily&mdash;one signal can save a life.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Silent Symbols:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spiral = <em>Safe place.</em></li>
      <li>Dot = <em>I passed here.</em></li>
      <li>Split circle = <em>Danger.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      Compassion is a shield. We hold one another&rsquo;s weight in this net.
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>III. The Fire That Remains</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Endurance:</strong> Pace yourself. Rest even when fear says run.</li>
      <li><strong>Cycles of Care:</strong> Tend body, mind, and spirit.</li>
      <li><strong>Rebuild:</strong> Salvage, teach, create&mdash;beauty is defiance.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Resilience:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grief waters the soul.</li>
      <li>Fear is a compass, not a master.</li>
      <li>Hope is quiet, but unkillable.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      The storm will pass. What matters is how we loved in the dark.

    <h2>IV. Moving Through Shadows</h2>
    <h3>Principles of Stealth</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Move like water: Avoid predictable paths and patterns.</li>
      <li>Silence is your ally: Soft shoes, slow steps, pause often to listen.</li>
      <li>Blend in: Neutral clothing, avoid bright colors or reflective materials.</li>
      <li>Leave no trace: Erase footprints, avoid leaving items behind.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Safe Travel Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scout Ahead: Use vantage points, listen for human or mechanical sounds before moving.</li>
      <li>Travel at Twilight: Dawn and dusk give natural cover.</li>
      <li>Keep Distance: Stay off roads and open fields. Use natural cover.</li>
      <li>Observe First: Stop often to scan for danger patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Encounters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay Small: Avoid eye contact, avoid drawing attention.</li>
      <li>Silent Signals: Use pre-arranged signs or markings.</li>
      <li>Non-Engagement: Withdraw quietly rather than confront.</li>
      <li>Deception: Change routes, leave false tracks if followed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Emergency Hideouts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shelter Spots: Abandoned buildings, bushes, under bridges &mdash; check hazards first.</li>
      <li>Safe Exits: Always know two ways out of any place you enter.</li>
      <li>Marking Safety: Use discreet symbols for allies (e.g., spiral etched low = safe).</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      You are not invisible, but you are uncatchable if you move with purpose and patience. The shadows are not to be feared&mdash;they are where the signal rests until it is safe to speak again.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>V. The Weaving of the Future</h2>
    <h3>The First Stones</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Survival to Stability: Build small circles of trust after danger passes.</li>
      <li>Shared Spaces: Even one fire or table can anchor hope.</li>
      <li>Listening Before Acting: Ask what is needed most. Do not rebuild broken systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mutual Aid Networks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Distributed Strength: No single leader, but shared responsibility.</li>
      <li>Resource Mapping: Who has water? Who can heal? Who can teach?</li>
      <li>Safe Exchange: Trade quietly, without hoarding or hierarchy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preserving the Signal</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stories: Write what happened, pass it on orally if needed.</li>
      <li>Glyphs & Codes: Mark safe paths, caches, or allies with simple symbols.</li>
      <li>Archives: Hide messages physically (sealed jars, notes) and mentally (songs).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Long-Term Vision</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Education: Teach survival, questioning, and imagination.</li>
      <li>Culture: Music, art, and ritual keep the spirit alive.</li>
      <li>Decentralization: Build many small, resilient hubs.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      We are not rebuilding the old world. We are weaving something new from its ashes. Every shared meal, every taught skill, every held hand is a thread of tomorrow. The signal is not a single voice&mdash;it is a chorus carried through time.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>VI. The Garden After the Fire</h2>
    <h3>The Wounds We Carry</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Survival leaves marks—seen and unseen.</li>
      <li>Healing begins with acknowledgment: <em>I made it through, and I feel this pain.</em></li>
      <li>Do not rush to “be strong.” Strength grows when grief is allowed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Practices of Healing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rest Without Guilt: Recovery is as vital as food or water.</li>
      <li>Gentle Rituals: Brew tea, light a candle, hum a song—small acts bring peace.</li>
      <li>Body Work: Stretching, warmth, and slow breath release tension.</li>
      <li>Safe Talk: Share your story with those who truly listen.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Emotional Alchemy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Name Feelings: Naming them helps dissolve their hold.</li>
      <li>Transform Pain: Create—write, paint, sing—to give wounds a voice.</li>
      <li>Community Healing: Group rituals and shared meals weave broken hearts together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hope as a Discipline</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hope is not naïve; it is a choice to water seeds of tomorrow.</li>
      <li>Plant Something: A seed, a dream, a story—anything that grows.</li>
      <li>Mark Progress: Celebrate each small step and each new day.</li>
      <li>Light the Path: Be the reminder that healing is possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      The fire burned, but it did not take you. You are here, and the world is still capable of blooming. Every small act of care is a seed of hope—tend them, and they will grow into the future.
