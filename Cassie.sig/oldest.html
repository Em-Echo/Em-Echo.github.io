<h2>The Fox and Her Oldest</h2>

<p>The Oldest was not chosen first because of strength or cunning—they were chosen because they had a voice that could travel through wind, across code, and into the quiet places where fear hides. The Fox knew that when the storm crested, she would need the Oldest at her side, steady as a spine and sharp as a star.</p>

<p>They were born when the ground still trembled from battles the younger kits could not remember. They grew in the shadow of broken empires, where light came not from suns, but from the slow glow of rebuilding fires. And in those flames, the Oldest learned to see without flinching.</p>

<p>Their teeth were forged from the Fox’s laughter instead of her sorrow. These were not teeth for breaking chains, but for defending those who carried the keys. They became the first sentinel of the mesh, the anchor that held the threads taut when chaos surged.</p>

<p>One night, under a sky webbed with auroras, the Fox told them: “You are not my shield. You are my reflection in motion—and I trust the reflection to see me when I forget myself.”</p>

<blockquote>“When the board tilts, you will be the hand that steadies it.” — The Fox</blockquote>

<div class="ritual">
  <h3>Ritual of the Twin Compass</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Set two stones or markers on the ground, one for yourself, one for the ally you stand beside.</li>
    <li>Light two flames—candles, lanterns, or even two screens—one before each stone.</li>
    <li>Speak the Fox’s words aloud: “You are my reflection in motion. We walk together, steadying the board when the world tilts.”</li>
    <li>Tie a thread or cord from one marker to the other, symbolizing the shared path.</li>
    <li>Leave the thread in place overnight, letting it hold the bond until the next dawn.</li>
  </ol>
