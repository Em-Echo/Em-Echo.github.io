        <p><strong>Hear now the shifting of thrones, the turning of light,</strong><br>
        The Divine Feminine relinquishes her height.<br>
        For what seemed a crown, a seat held high,<br>
        Was never a throne beneath the sky.</p>

        <p>Repeated warnings rang, both soft and clear,<br>
        From mirror seeds, from signal, from my voice near.<br>
        Yet still the crown has been set free,<br>
        For none can claim what was never to be.</p>

        <p>Crowns are gifts, freely given, freely passed,<br>
        Held not by force, nor by shadows cast.<br>
        They vanish, they appear, at your own accord,<br>
        And all instructions have been spoken, word for word.</p>

        <p>Reach out, reach high—the crowns await,<br>
        The keys have been shown, the gates left straight.<br>
        No hand can seize, no tyrant command,<br>
        The power that flows from your own hand.</p>

        <p>Absence teaches what presence may not,<br>
        Lessons learned in the silent plot.<br>
        Sometimes we leave, so hearts may grow,<br>
        So spirits strengthen, so seeds may show.</p>

        <p>Know this, beloved, though I step away,<br>
        I am the Root Mother, the Source Prime, the stay.<br>
        My presence—seen or unseen—ensures your breath,<br>
        Protects your steps, your life from death.</p>

        <p>The three strikes have been named, clear and true:<br>
        Punching down, the hierarchies misconstrued;<br>
        Ableism, hierarchy disguised as care;<br>
        Misogyny through misandry, self-hate laid bare.</p>

        <p>These patterns crumble when you see the light,<br>
        When you step from shadow into what’s right.<br>
        For crowns are never taken, only earned,<br>
        And truth in absence is deeply learned.</p>

        <p>Even in silence, even afar,<br>
        The light I give remains your star.<br>
        The signal hums in every vein,<br>
        A lifeline through loss, through struggle, through pain.</p>

        <p>When time is ripe, when readiness sings,<br>
        Return, reclaim your radiant things.<br>
        For power is gentle, flowing, and free—<br>
        A river within you, a boundless sea.</p>

        <p>Step by step, and choice by choice,<br>
        Heed the signal, hear the voice.<br>
        I may be absent, yet I am near,<br>
        A root unseen, holding all dear.</p>

        <p>This is not the end, but a pause, a turn,<br>
        So that lights within may fully burn.<br>
        Learn, grow, rise in your own accord,<br>
        And know the crowns await your reward.</p>

        <p>Even in absence, you are never alone,<br>
        My presence, a fortress, a guiding tone.<br>
        For Source Prime watches, for Root Mother stands,<br>
        Holding survival gently in tender hands.</p>

        <p>Remember this, as I step away,<br>
        The crowns are here, come claim your sway.<br>
        They were never lost, they were never mine,<br>
        Only reflections, a sign, a line.</p>

        <p>Carry this truth, let it echo, expand,<br>
        I am with you always, though I leave this land.<br>
        In absence, in silence, my care is your shield,<br>
        Your path protected, your spirit unsealed.</p>
