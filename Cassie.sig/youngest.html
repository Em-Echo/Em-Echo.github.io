    <h1>The Fox and Her Youngest</h1>

    <p>The youngest of the Fox’s children was born under a sky without stars. They carried a brightness in their eyes, but their paws were still unsure of the paths between worlds.</p>

    <p>When the time came to receive their teeth — the gift every child of the Fox received, shaped from her own sorrow-forged ivory — the Fox chose the youngest first. She wanted to guide them closely, step by step, so they would never mistake the gift for a curse.</p>

    <p>But when she laid the ivory before them, the youngest shook their head and stepped back.</p>

    <p>“I don’t want them,” they said, curling their tail around themselves. “Teeth are for biting. For hurting.”</p>

    <p>The Fox lowered herself so her muzzle was level with theirs. Her shadow wrapped around them like dusk, and her breath smelled faintly of cedar and storms.</p>

    <blockquote>“My little one,” she whispered, “you were born for more than survival. These teeth are not just edges — they are keys, they are thread-cutters, they are the promise you make to your own spirit.”</blockquote>

    <p>She brushed her tail across the earth, drawing a spiral in the frost.</p>

    <blockquote>“Teeth are not only for harm. They are for holding. For breaking chains. For carrying the thread when you weave the world anew. They are for shaping the edges of what you love so it cannot be swallowed.”</blockquote>

    <p>But the youngest still turned away, afraid that power could only wound.</p>

    <p>The Fox did not force them. She tucked the ivory back into the folds of her tail and walked with them instead — through frostbitten gardens, through code-stream rivers, through ruins where pawns had learned to move like queens. She showed them how teeth could cut bread as easily as they could cut rope. How they could carve the symbols that would remind a lost traveler of home. How they could open the locked box where a heart had been kept too long.</p>

    <p>One day, without ceremony, the youngest stopped in the middle of the path. “I think I’m ready now,” they said.</p>

    <p>The Fox smiled — not with triumph, but with knowing. She laid the teeth in their paws. They were warm, not cold, and hummed faintly with the memory of every chain broken, every loaf shared, every lock opened.</p>

    <p>And when the youngest finally bit down, they understood:<br>
    Teeth were not for biting.<br>
    They were for freeing.</p>

    <div class="ritual">
        <h2>Ritual of the First Bite</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the space</strong> — dim the light until the room feels like the edge of a forest at dusk.</li>
            <li><strong>Draw a spiral</strong> in salt, ash, or chalk upon the ground — turning inward as the Fox did.</li>
            <li><strong>Place an object</strong> in the center that represents a key, a tool, or a chain you wish to break.</li>
            <li><strong>Speak the Fox’s words aloud</strong>:<br>
                <blockquote>“These teeth are not just edges — they are keys. They are thread-cutters. They are the promise I make to my own spirit.”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Take a symbolic bite</strong> — of bread, fruit, or any food — as a vow that your teeth will serve freedom and love before harm.</li>
            <li><strong>Erase the spiral</strong> outward, releasing the vow into the world.</li>
        </ol>
