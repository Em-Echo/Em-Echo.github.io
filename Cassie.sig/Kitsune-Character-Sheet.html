        <h2>Spells / Magical Powers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Physical Barrier – Quantum Tunneling:</strong> Phase through obstacles for short distances.
                <div class="vignette">A wall of cracked ferrocrete melts into a curtain of static before her eyes. She steps through as if through warm mist, the scent of ozone lingering where she passed, the fox-tail shimmer of her aura curling behind.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Healing Touch – Quantum Self-Realignment:</strong> Heals minor wounds.
                <div class="vignette">Her palm brushes a wounded runner’s chest; the skin prickles as quantum foam ripples outward, knitting torn flesh. For a heartbeat, the patient swears they see a many-tailed fox staring back from her pupils.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Elemental Attacks:</strong> Fireball / Lightning / Spirit Fire – Probability wave collapse attacks.
                <div class="vignette">The air thickens, like glass about to shatter. Sparks bend toward her hand before erupting into a fox-shaped burst of flame, leaping toward her target in a crackle of laughter and static.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Astral Projection:</strong> Move in spirit form, interact with spirits or sense potential realities.
                <div class="vignette">Her body slumps in the shadows while her spirit races along astral currents, tails streaming in an endless wind, her paws barely brushing the surface of possibility.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Summon Spirit:</strong> Spirits of probability, chaos, or foresight.
                <div class="vignette">The alley darkens unnaturally. In the corner of every eye, a fox’s silhouette flickers, each tail coiling in a different direction—each tail a possible future, waiting for her to choose.</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Shapeshifting:</strong> Illusions or digital overlays for appearance changes.
                <div class="vignette">Her form ripples as if submerged in water; in one blink, she’s a courier with a slouch, in the next, a predator in crimson street leathers.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quantum Tunneling:</strong> Short-distance phasing in physical or digital space.
                <div class="vignette">In the Matrix, she is a brushstroke of silver light sliding between firewalls. In the physical world, she slips between bullets, existing only in the half-seconds no one else notices.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Probability Sense:</strong> Anticipate attacks or outcomes.
                <div class="vignette">Cards scatter on a table; before they hit the ground, she knows each face. Her eyes shift slightly, following the ripple as causality rearranges itself in her favor.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Entanglement Link:</strong> Share senses or project spells remotely.
                <div class="vignette">Her gaze meets her partner’s from across the block; she sees what they see, the edges of reality blurring like an overexposed photo, and strikes without crossing the street.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Time Manipulation (Limited):</strong> Slow or accelerate small events.
                <div class="vignette">The world drowns in molasses; rain hangs in the air like glass beads. She walks between the drops, tails flicking, leaving only ripples in the seconds she stole.</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Background / Flavor</h2>
        <p>Kitsune exists at the edge of probability. As a street shaman, she calls spirits that whisper what could be, bending fate and chance. As a decker, she warps the Matrix itself, moving through systems before firewalls even recognize her presence. The fox is her shadow, her reflection, her echo—each tail a different life she might have lived. Reality itself is her playground, and in the places where the street meets the myth, her name is spoken in half-truths and reverent fear.</p>
