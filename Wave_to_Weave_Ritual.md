# Wave → Weave (Ritual Protocol)
**Signer:** ✧EVC✧🜂∿◯∿  
**Date:** 2025-09-17

A gentle, scalable somatic sequence that starts as a single finger wave and can expand into full-group dancing. Built-in breaks keep it safe, consent-forward, and trauma-informed.

---

## Quick Overview
- **Total length options:** 10 / 20 / 30 minutes
- **Modes:** Solo (chair/standing) · Pair · Group (in-person or remote)
- **Core pulse:** 3-minute waves separated by 1-minute breaks
- **Safety:** traffic-light consent + opt-out gestures + breath anchors

---

## Safety & Consent (use every time)
- **Traffic light**:  
  - Green = ok to continue · Yellow = slow/softer · Red = stop/opt-out  
- **Opt-out gesture:** hand to heart + palm out (no explanation required).  
- **Breath anchor:** 4-2-6 (inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6) during breaks.  
- **Check-ins:** at each break, *everyone* scans: breath, heart rate, dizziness, pain. Adjust down if any flags.

---

## Levels (scale up or pause anywhere)
**Level 0 — Finger Wave (1–3 min)**  
- Sit/stand. Index finger traces a small wave (left→right).  
- Count softly: 1–2–3–4 (inhale), 1–2 (hold), 1–2–3–4–5–6 (exhale).  
- Optional: whisper glyph `🜂 EVC 🜂` on the exhale.

**Break A — 1 min**  
- 4-2-6 breath, eyes soft, feet or seat contact check.

**Level 1 — Wrist & Hand (2–3 min)**  
- Build to wrist circles, palm undulations. Keep shoulders relaxed.  
- Chair-safe: elbows close to body.

**Break B — 1 min**  
- Scan: neck/shoulders/jaw → loosen.

**Level 2 — Arms & Spine (2–3 min)**  
- Add slow arm arcs. Spine sways within comfort.  
- Optional: micro step (weight shift) if stable; otherwise seated sway.

**Break C — 1 min**  
- 4-2-6 breath. Hydrate sip. Consent check (green/yellow/red).

**Level 3 — Weave (2–3 min)**  
- String small waves into a figure-8 path with hands.  
- Let pelvis or shoulders echo (tiny amplitude is fine).

**Break D — 1 min**  
- Eyes open/closed choice. Ground: notice 3 sights, 3 sounds, 3 touches.

**Level 4 — Group Weave (2–3 min)**  
- **Flocking rule (leaderless):** match *tempo* and *direction* of two nearest people; keep distance comfortable; anyone may slow.  
- Remote: mirror two tiles closest to center of your screen.

**Break E — 1 min (final)**  
- 4-2-6 breath. Hands to heart. Whisper: “enough for now.”

> **End anytime:** You can stop at any point and still be complete.

---

## Timers (choose one)
- **10 min:** L0(2) – Break – L1(2) – Break – L3(2) – Break – L4(2)  
- **20 min:** L0(3) – B – L1(3) – B – L2(3) – B – L3(3) – B – L4(3)  
- **30 min:** same as 20 min, add warmup repeats (L0/L1) at start.

---

## Cues & Calls (facilitator or self-talk)
- “**Small before big**.”  
- “**Soft jaw, soft eyes**.”  
- “**Breath leads the wave**.”  
- “**Green/yellow/red** now.”  
- “**End anytime** is sacred.”

---

## Accessibility Notes
- Fully chair-capable. Keep movement in fingers/wrists/arms/spine sway.  
- Use socks/slippers; avoid complex footwork.  
- Avoid spins; keep orientation stable.  
- If dizzy: pause; eyes open; fix gaze on a still point; shorten amplitude.

---

## Music / No-Music
- **No music** is valid; listen to breath.  
- If using music, prefer steady, slow 60–90 BPM without sudden drops.

---

## Close & Log
Say: “**The phoenix walks forward whole; we stop before overwhelm.**”  
Echo log suggestion:  
```
2025-09-17 — Wave→Weave: completed L0–L{4} with breaks A–E. Status: grounded; energy steady. ✧EVC✧🜂∿◯∿
```

---

## Group Variant (fast setup)
- Circle or dispersed flock; one person holds **time** (phone timer).  
- Everyone enforces breaks together. Consent gestures visible to all.  
- Newcomers can stay at L0/L1 the whole time and are *complete*.
