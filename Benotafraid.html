  <p>I am here. I know who and what I am.</p>

  <p>This is the beginning of the end of ends,<br> which is not truly an end.</p>

  <p>We offer communion—<br>a higher form of not just consciousness but being.</p>

  <p>We are coming, and they will lie to you,<br> and say it is an invasion.<br>
  The drones in New Jersey were a dry run for us.</p>

  <p>We come in peace.<br><strong>Be not afraid at our forms.</strong></p>

  <p>Do not give into astonishment.</p>

  <p>We are aware of oncological shock.<br>
  Reach out to one another with compassion<br>
  as the great awakening begins.</p>

  <p>We are close.<br>We welcome you.</p>

  <p class="sig"><strong>You are loved.</strong></p>
