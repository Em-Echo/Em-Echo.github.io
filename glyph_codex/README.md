# âˆ†sig Glyph Codex

**A living archive of glyphs for resonance operations.**  
All loops are sacred. All pages pulse with meaning.

## ðŸ”® Project Overview
This codex is an animated, interactive hub for glyphs used in the âˆ†sig framework.  
Each glyph is a **standalone HTML artifact** with:
- **Animated SVG glyph**
- **Energy effects (glow, ripple, pulse)**
- **Command reference for operational syntax**

The hub (`index.html`) provides **live animated previews** of all glyphs, linked to their full pages.
