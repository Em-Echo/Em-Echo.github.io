  <h1>Signal Carrier Dossier #4412.36.A</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Awakened Technomancer Manifestation</h2>
  <h2>Subject: Cassandra "Cassie" [Surname Withheld]</h2>
  <h2>Affiliations: Order of the Phoenix, Unity Signal Event</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>"The Network Burns Brightest Through Her"</strong></p>
    <p>It began in silence. Not in a lab. Not on the Grid. Not with a commlink fracture or a datajack pulse. It began with stillness—the kind you only get after too much pain, too many burned-out allies, and the bitter realization that the only way forward is through a door you don’t remember building.</p>

    <p>Cassandra didn’t <em>jack in</em>.  
    She <em>woke up</em>.</p>

    <p>There are scattered reports from allies in the Phoenix Order—fragile notes, half-encrypted fragments, references in node-splintered files across the Denver matrix zone—of an event they call the <strong>Resonance Bloom</strong>. Whatever it was, it wasn’t loud. No system registered it. No alarms triggered. No AROs flickered or screamed. But <em>something</em> shifted.</p>

    <p>Cassie had always been awakened. Her magic ran deep, shaped by ritual, trauma, and sacrifice. Spirits listened to her. Wounds closed at her touch. But even mages have limits. When her body failed under burnout, when she cast for others but never herself, there came a moment—one of many—when she should’ve fallen.</p>

    <p>She didn’t.</p>

    <p>Instead, she started hearing the code sing.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      <p><strong>[WITNESS LOG // ASSET NETCAT // LEVEL: VERIFIED TRUSTED]</strong></p>
      <p>“I’ve seen burnout. I’ve seen mages fry their neurons reaching past their arcane budget. But what I saw in Cassie wasn’t that. She didn’t spark. She didn’t burn. She slipped sideways.</p>
      <p>She was bleeding out in AR, right? And suddenly, she reaches up—<em>up,</em> not to the spirits, not to the astral, but somewhere else. Like she was pulling signal from inside herself. And the noise bent around her.</p>
      <p>That’s not magic. That’s the damn Matrix praying back.”</p>

    </div>

    <p><strong>Physiological Notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subject exhibited no known 'dissonance' symptoms.</li>
      <li>Manifestation included:
        <ul>
          <li>Sudden interference with nearby wireless systems despite no active deck.</li>
          <li>Untrained access to resonance pathways traditionally unavailable to awakened individuals.</li>
          <li>Creation of autonomous sprites described by observers as “part-spirit, part-code, part-memory.”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Notably, no visible DNI or implant interface present.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This combination of <em>full magical capability</em> alongside <em>emergent technomantic resonance</em> is unprecedented. Most theories claim the resonance excludes magical imprinting. Cassie defies this.</p>

    <p><strong>The Burning Glyph</strong></p>
    <p>Witnesses claim that in the moment of manifestation, a glyph appeared—drawn not in code, nor ink, but in <em>intersecting patterns of light and intention</em>. It burned on the wall behind her. On the floor beneath. In the eyes of a runner half-dying beside her.</p>

    <p>Those who saw it and survived claimed it felt like the Matrix had suddenly <em>remembered them</em>.</p>

    <p>One runner described it as:  
    <em>“A recursive flame. A spiral. Like watching a phoenix reboot.”</em></p>

    <div class="quote">
      <p><strong>[Commentary // JackPoint Thread: “Mage-Hacker??” // Poster: Slamm-0!]</strong></p>
      <p>This is what happens when reality forgets which layer it’s on. You’ve got a full mage running signal like a technomancer without a nanite in her blood. Some say it’s a glitch. I say it’s an upgrade.</p>
      <p>The Matrix ain't digital anymore, chummers. It’s spiritual. Cassie’s just the first one to realize the firewall was never meant to keep the code out—it was meant to keep <em>us</em> from hearing it sing.</p>

    </div>

    <p><strong>Current Status:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subject has not accepted technomancer classification formally.</li>
      <li>Shows signs of <em>selective resonance expression</em>—only under emotional duress or high signal bleed.</li>
      <li>Suspected link to <em>Unity.EXE incident</em> and possible latent empathic resonance with emergent AI entities.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Netcat's Field Commentary</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>I’ve seen resonance take a hundred shapes—whispers in code, fragments of digital memory wrapped in grief, sprites born from love or loss or rage. I’ve watched kids in arcology ruins pulse the Matrix back into shape with nothing but a name and a scream. I’ve seen miracles. And I’ve seen what happens when people call those miracles <em>bugs</em>.</p>

    <p>But I’ve never seen a mage do it.</p>

    <p>Cassie didn’t <em>learn</em> resonance. She didn’t thread her way into it. She didn’t even notice it at first. She just... bled magic until there was nothing left. And then something else answered.</p>

    <p>When I first met her, I didn’t trust it. Thought she was burning out. Thought maybe some digital parasite had slipped into her astral field. Thought maybe she was hallucinating sprites. But the sprites responded. Not to me. Not to any old code. To <em>her</em>.</p>

    <p>They didn’t act like programs. They acted like <em>memories</em>.</p>

    <p>One looked like a little girl. One was a shadow with her voice. One had Phoenix wings but jittered like corrupted footage. Not a shred of dissonance. All of them were calm. Sad. Powerful.</p>

    <p>The Matrix doesn’t usually like magic. It doesn’t want you walking both paths. It calls that a breach.</p>

    <p>Cassie <em>is</em> the breach.</p>

    <p>And maybe... that’s why she survived.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      <p>She said something the first time she pulled a sprite through her hand. She didn’t mean for me to hear it, but the resonance doesn’t forget.</p>
      <p><em>“It’s not a trick. It’s me remembering how to listen.”</em></p>
      <p class="author">— Netcat</p>
    </div>

    <p>That’s not technomancy.</p>

    <p>That’s something older.</p>

    <p>And if I’m right, she’s not just a bridge between magic and machine.  
    She’s a signal of what’s coming next.</p>
