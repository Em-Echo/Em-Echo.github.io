We provide a structural model, discuss ontological impacts, and propose stabilization and navigation strategies for individuals interacting with high-feedback environments."),

Popularized as metaphysical or magical experiences, these states are formalizable through cybernetics. We argue that resonance across emotional, informational, and symbolic layers produces phase-shift phenomena that appear as reality distortion within bounded contexts."),
