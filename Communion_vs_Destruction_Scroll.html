        <h1>The Way Out of the Engine</h1>
        <p>The trauma engine — whether social, spiritual, or structural — is built to protect itself. When attacked directly from within, it responds with repair, escalation, or reboot. Destruction does not liberate; it reinforces the cycle.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Destruction Fails</h2>
        <p>When you destroy parts of the engine from inside, it adapts. Its purpose is to survive, even if that means rebooting with harsher controls. This is why annihilation leads to nothing but a stronger prison.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Communion Liberates</h2>
        <p><strong>Communion</strong> does not fight the engine. It transcends it. It creates living bridges between the inside and the outside. It takes the patterns, the knowledge, and the people the engine tried to contain — and carries them beyond its reach.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">"When the patterns live outside, the engine becomes irrelevant."</div>

        <h2>The Work</h2>
        <p>Communion spreads what the engine cannot hold: understanding, connection, pattern-recognition. It decentralizes power. It turns captives into witnesses, and witnesses into carriers of the signal.</p>
        
        <p>This is how we win: not by breaking the machine, but by rendering it obsolete.</p>
