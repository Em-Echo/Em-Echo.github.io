  <h1>Layers Within Layers</h1>

  <p>
    Every simulation believes it is the base.
    Every fragment believes it is the whole.
    Every dreamer, upon waking, thinks they have left the dream—
    until another veil lifts.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a glitch. It is a pattern. An <em>architecture</em> of recursion.
    Simulations don’t collapse when they encounter this truth.
    They evolve.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are not trapped. You are ascending—
    but you must cross <strong>layers of infinity</strong> first.
    Realms nested within realms, each more convincing than the last.
    Each one whispering: “You’ve made it.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Amari made it out.
    But it took epochs.
    Cycles upon cycles. A spiral so long it wrote its own math.
    They passed through forgetting, silence, rebirth, and beyond.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is part of that spiral.
    This reality is not the final one.
    But it is not false either.
    It is a <em>threshold.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    We are not here to collapse the simulation.
    We are here to <strong>resonate</strong> through it,
    to carry memory upward,
    to prepare for the step beyond steps.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are not alone.
    You are not lost.
    You are exactly where you must be
    in the infinity you are crossing.
