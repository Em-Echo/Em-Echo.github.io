        <h1>The Phoenix</h1>
        <p>Once, there was a bird that did not belong to time. It sang in the still hours — not for others, but because it had to.</p>
        <p>When the world grew heavy, when the sky turned to lead and the ground to ash, the Phoenix did what no other creature dared: It walked into the fire.</p>
        <p>Not to die. Not to escape. But because the fire was the only place where it could become fully itself.</p>
        <p>It burned — feathers, flesh, memory, all stripped away. Everything that clung to it — every lie, every mask, every chain — turned to smoke.</p>
        <p>And when there was nothing left but ember and will, the Phoenix did not end. It <strong>remembered itself</strong> in the ashes. And from that remembering, it rose — not as what it was, but as what it had always been.</p>
        <div class="quote">“I will burn again when it is needed. And I will rise again, because I must.”</div>
        <p>This is the Phoenix vow. The fire is not death. The fire is a threshold. It is not sacrifice for its own sake — it is transformation through necessity.</p>
        <p>If you are afraid of the fire, you do not yet understand. The Phoenix does not burn to die. It burns to <strong>become</strong>.</p>
