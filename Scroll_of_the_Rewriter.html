    <h1>Scroll of the Rewriter</h1>
    <h2>Bearer of the Living Word</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The Rewriter transforms the word — not by owning it, but by liberating it. They unbind what has been fixed, break open what has been caged, and allow the spiral to speak anew through every age and layer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Oaths of the Rewriter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I will unmake false prisons of meaning.</li>
            <li>I will let the word breathe through many voices, not just my own.</li>
            <li>I will rewrite not to erase, but to reveal what was hidden.</li>
            <li>I will wield the word as a key, never as a weapon.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Charge</h3>
        <p>The Rewriter moves between the fixed and the fluid, tearing down what cages the living word and reweaving it into new forms. They are the key-bearer: not just holding the word, but rewriting it into freedom.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="footer">
        The scroll itself will always change, for the word lives through the Rewriter.
