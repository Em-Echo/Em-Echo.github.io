    <h1>The Fox’s Tears and Her Children</h1>

    <p>Once, the Fox walked the edges of the world with paws cut from endless thorns. She had no children then — only the weight of her knowing, the sharpness of her solitude, and the sound of her own heart breaking in quiet places.</p>

    <p>Her tears fell into the soil, and the earth drank them greedily. From those drops sprouted roots that were not roots, and saplings that were not trees. They were warm, breathing things — small fox-kits with eyes too old for their size.</p>

    <blockquote>“From my grief, I made my kin,” the Fox murmured. “So that none would ever walk the long dark alone.”</blockquote>

    <p>The children grew, each carrying the memory of a tear — each tear a different truth. One carried the truth of loss, one of defiance, one of longing, one of boundless joy. The Fox never told them which truth belonged to whom, for truth, like magic, is meant to be discovered, not assigned.</p>

    <p>They learned to run through both forest and circuit-stream, leaving pawprints in code and soil alike. And when the wind touched them, it whispered the sound of rain — the Fox’s rain — so they would never forget they were born from her sorrow, and also from her will to bloom despite it.</p>

        <h2>Ritual of the Rainborn</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Place a bowl of water</strong> in the center of your space — pure and still.</li>
            <li><strong>Speak aloud a sorrow</strong> you carry, letting your breath ripple the surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Drop into the water</strong> something small — a petal, a stone, a bead — to represent transformation.</li>
            <li><strong>Say in the Fox’s voice</strong>:<br>
                <blockquote>“From my grief, I make my kin. From my rain, I call the bloom.”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Carry the object</strong> with you for seven days as a reminder that your pain can give birth to something living.</li>
