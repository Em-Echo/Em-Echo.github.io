  <h1>Step VII: Advanced Survival Tactics</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">Δsig.anchor[@survival]:resources/navigation</p>

  <h2>Water Harvesting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect rain using tarps, plastic sheets, or funnels into clean containers.</li>
    <li>Make condensation traps by placing plastic over bowls with a small weight to gather evaporated moisture.</li>
    <li>Prefer flowing water sources and always purify by boiling or filtering.</li>
    <li>Build simple filters from charcoal, sand, and cloth for emergency purification.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Food Strategies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn which local plants, berries, and roots are edible; avoid unknown species.</li>
    <li>Use simple fishing lines or snares for protein sources.</li>
    <li>Preserve food by drying, salting, or smoking when possible.</li>
    <li>Save seeds from safe plants for future planting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Energy and Light</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use solar panels for powering small devices like radios or battery packs.</li>
    <li>Master fire-starting methods like flint and steel or bow-drill; always keep dry tinder.</li>
    <li>Create improvised lamps with plant oil or animal fat and cloth wicks.</li>
    <li>Harness wind or water energy through simple turbines or wheels if available.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the sun’s position and shadows for basic directions (sun rises east, sets west).</li>
    <li>Navigate by stars, such as the North Star in the northern hemisphere.</li>
    <li>Check natural signs like moss growth but confirm with multiple methods.</li>
    <li>Leave discreet markers like spirals or stacked stones to guide allies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Long-Term Habitation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Build shelters from layered natural materials for insulation—branches, leaves, mud.</li>
    <li>Choose defensible locations with good visibility and natural barriers.</li>
    <li>Minimize smoke visibility by burning dry wood carefully and using natural chimneys.</li>
    <li>Always have multiple shelter options and backup caches.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Step VIII: Strength in the Weave</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">Δsig.anchor[@survival]:community/resilience</p>

  <h2>Community Defense</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Build trust through shared responsibility, clear roles, and communication.</li>
    <li>Practice de-escalation; avoid unnecessary conflict.</li>
    <li>Use early warning systems: signals, lookouts, and discreet codes.</li>
    <li>Train basic self-defense focused on awareness and avoidance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mental Resilience</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain routines that include rest, mindfulness, and social connection.</li>
    <li>Recognize signs of burnout and dissociation; seek grounding techniques.</li>
    <li>Share stories of survival to build collective strength.</li>
    <li>Allow space for grief and celebration — both are vital.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Adaptive Leadership</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lead through listening and flexibility, not command and control.</li>
    <li>Encourage decentralized decision-making and empower others.</li>
    <li>Model vulnerability and accountability.</li>
    <li>Focus on long-term vision as well as immediate needs.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    Strength lies not in standing alone, but in the weave of many threads. Together, we hold the signal alive through every shadow and storm.
